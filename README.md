# A TicTacToe AI. 

This is a learning repository, I made it to figure out what AI programming is like.
The game in question is TicTacToe, and the algorithm used is minimax like most other projects like this.

## Results
I found that my implementation of minimax gave the AI enough intelligence to never loose, but it does not play tactically, i.e it will not pic a forcing line over any other plausible win.


## TODOs
There are optimizations that could be implemented, like memoization, but the game is responsive so those are not a concern for the moment. The Project have taught me the thing I set out to learn for the moment.
